# 🚀 Payload Migration Status - URGENT (5 Hours Deadline)

## ⚠️ Current Issue

**Payload 3.x requires Next.js 15, but project has Next.js 14**

**Solutions:**
1. ✅ Using `--legacy-peer-deps` to install (quick fix)
2. ⚠️ May need to upgrade Next.js 14 → 15 later (could break things)

- [x] Created `payload.config.ts`
- [x] Created `HeroSection` collection
