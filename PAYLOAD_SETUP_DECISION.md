# ⚠️ IMPORTANT DECISION NEEDED

## Current Situation

**Payload CMS 3.x requires Next.js 15**, but your project uses **Next.js 14**.

**Status:**
- ✅ Payload installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` (works but not ideal)
- ✅ Config files created
- ⚠️ **Version mismatch may cause issues**

## Options

### Option 1: Continue with Payload (Recommended for Long-term)

**Pros:**
- ✅ Solves all Strapi restrictions permanently
- ✅ Better long-term solution
- ✅ Full programmatic control

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ May need to upgrade Next.js 14 → 15 (could break things)
- ⚠️ More setup time (might take longer than 5 hours)
- ⚠️ Risk of compatibility issues

**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours to fully migrate and test

---

### Option 2: Quick Fix - Keep Strapi But Fix It

**Pros:**
- ✅ Faster (30-60 minutes)
- ✅ No breaking changes
- ✅ Can complete homepage today

**Cons:**
- ❌ Still have Strapi restrictions
- ❌ Manual work needed for content types

**Time Estimate:** 30-60 minutes

---

### Option 3: Hybrid - Use Strapi Now, Migrate Payload Later

**Pros:**
- ✅ Complete homepage today (using Strapi)
- ✅ Migrate to Payload later when we have more time
- ✅ Best of both worlds

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to do migration work twice

**Time Estimate:** 1 hour now (Strapi fix) + 2-3 hours later (Payload migration)

---

## My Recommendation

**Given the 5-hour deadline:**

**Option 3 (Hybrid)** - Fix Strapi now to complete homepage today, migrate to Payload later when we have more time.

**OR**

**Option 1 (Payload)** - If you want to do it right once, let's continue with Payload (I'll work fast).

---

## What Do You Want?

1. **Continue with Payload** (might take 2-3 hours, but permanent solution)
2. **Quick fix Strapi** (30-60 min, complete homepage today)
3. **Hybrid approach** (fix Strapi now, migrate Payload later)

**Your call!** I'll work fast either way. 🚀
